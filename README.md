# tech-crashcourse
Hi, my friend! As a software engineer, sometimes I have to pick up some tech-related concepts or skills in a short time and the most effective way I find is by self-learning. 

As a non-English speaker, I feel the strong need to promote my English skills to become a more efficient learner, since most of learning materials I found helpful on the Internet is written in English. 

Thus, taking notes in English can help me achieve both goals. Besides, sharing my notes to all of you makes the whole learning process even better. I'd like to hear voice from you, which makes me feel connected to the outside world.

Now, let us join my coding adventure!
