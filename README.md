# tech-crashcourse

Hi, my friend! As a software engineer, sometimes I have to pick up some tech-related concepts or skills in a short time and the most effective way I find is by self-learning. 

As a non-English speaker, I feel the strong need for promoting my English skills to become a more efficient learner, since most of learning materials I've found helpful on the Internet is written in English. 

The best thing of taking notes in English is that it helps me achieve both goals. Besides, sharing my notes to all of you makes the whole learning process even worthier. I'd like to hear from you, which makes me feel connected to the outside world.

Now, let us join my coding adventure!

## before learning

While I am learning, I am also curious about how to learn fast and learn smart. There are so many methodologies out there, but I find these tips a lot easier to follow:

- Take breaks between every 30 min. (Gradually you can keep concentrated longer.)
- Create a dedicated study area. (Even use a 'study-only' lamp.)
- How to read textbooks. (Go through it to find important concepts and questions before read.)
- Memorize by rote or active learning. 
- Really know it, rather than recognize it. (Only if you can repeat it are you able to master it.)
- Teach others in your own words. (Even explain to an unreal person)
